## üöÄ About Me

I'm a frontend developer passionate about building solid, established web applications that make a real difference. My journey into software engineering was inspired by the potential of technology to solve real-world problems, particularly in the mental health space.

I'm currently enhancing my skills through the ALX Frontend Program, with a specific focus on creating mental healthcare web and desktop applications that address the needs of young Africans. I believe in the power of clean, accessible, and user-centered design to create impactful digital experiences.
